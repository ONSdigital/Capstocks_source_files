calcAnnualCVMFlow       Calculate the annual CVM where the input time
                        series represent flow values
calcAnnualCVMStock      Calculate the annual CVM where the input time
                        series represent stock values
calcScalingFactor       Calculate the scaling factor (a function of the
                        current year and previous year prices). This is
                        used to calculate the unconstrained CVM.
calcUnconstrainedCVM    Calculates the unconstrained CVM which is a
                        function of the current year prices, previous
                        year prices and a scaling factor
