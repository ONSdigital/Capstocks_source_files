\usage{
unchain(.data1, cpColumn = "CP", cvmColumn = "CVM",
  deflatorColumn = NULL, deflatorMethod = c("implicit", "explicit"))
}
\arguments{
\item{.data1}{A data.frame with the current price, chained volume measures and
year information. The data.frame must also contain a Year column and optionally
a deflator column.}

\item{cpColumn}{The column name for the current price data ("CP" by default).}

\item{cvmColumn}{The column name for the CVM data ("CVM" by default). Can be ommitted if a deflator is provided.}

\item{deflatorColumn}{The column name for an optional deflator, see Details.}

\item{deflatorMethod}{String denoting deflator calculation method, "implicit"
or "explicit", see Details.}
}
\value{
The input data.frame with the addition of two columns (CYP and PYP).
}
\description{
Unchain current price series into current year prices and previous year prices.
}
\details{
CYP and PYP values are calculated from a deflator. If the deflatorMethod is
"implicit" a CVM column must be provided from which to calculate a deflator
(CP divided by CVM). If the deflatorMethod is "explicit" a deflator column
must be provided and its values are used directly.
Updated by LeighP 28-11-18
CYP value now calcualated using an interim CYP and adjustment Factor
1. interimCYP - CP Values divided by average deflator
2. interimCYPSum - Sum of interimCYP values by Year
3. CPSum - Sum of CP values by Year
4. adjFactor - Sum of CP values divided by Sum of interimCYP values
5 . CYP - CP values divided by adjustment Factor
