\title{Combines a given retirement distribution and individual asset price (or efficiency)
profile to give the price (or efficiency) profile of a cohort of assets. This version
of the function uses the fixed profile method of combining the two inputs.}
\usage{
cohortProfileTwo(survivalValues, profileFunction,
  profileConversionFunction = NULL, discountRate = NULL,
  inflationRate = NULL, profileFunctionParam = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{survivalValues}{a vector of real numbers in the interval [0,1]
representing the survival function of a retirement distribution}

\item{profileFunction}{a functional form of a single asset price (or efficiency) profile}

\item{profileConversionFunction}{one of (priceToEfficiencyProfile, efficiencyToPriceProfile)}

\item{discountRate}{a real number between [0,1]}

\item{inflationRate}{a real number between [0,1]}

\item{profileFunctionParam}{any parameter to be passed on to the profile function}
}
\value{
A vector of monotonically decreasing real numbers in the interval [0,1]
representing the price (or efficiency) profile of an asset vintage evaluated
at regular intervals of one period
}
\description{
Combines a given retirement distribution and individual asset price (or efficiency)
profile to give the price (or efficiency) profile of a cohort of assets. This version
of the function uses the fixed profile method of combining the two inputs.
