\arguments{
\item{profileType}{the type of profile: age-efficiency or age-price}

\item{profileFunctionName}{the name of a functional form of a single asset
price (or efficiency) profile. Options are linear (lin), geometric (geom),
constant (const), declining balance (db) or hyperbolic (hp)}

\item{retirementDistName}{the function name of the retirement distribution.
Options are Normal (pnorm), Weibull (pweibull), Log-Normal (plnorm) or
Gamma (pgamma)}

\item{rightTruncate}{logical value indicating if the retirement distribution
should be right truncated (TRUE) or not (FALSE)}

\item{combinationMethod}{the method employed to combine the age-efficieny/age-price
profile with the retirement distribution. This can either be the weighted
average ("1") or fixed profile ("2")}

\item{discountRate}{a real number between [0,1]}

\item{inflationRate}{a real number between [0,1]}

\item{offSet}{a real number between [0,1] representing the period at which
gfcf occurs and at which survival probabilities are evaluated}

\item{profileFunctionParam}{any parameters to be passed on to the profile function}

\item{discountRates}{a time series of discount rates with the same length as the
time series of GFCF. When set this value will take precedent over the single discount rate.}
