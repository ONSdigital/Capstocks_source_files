\title{Combines a given retirement distribution and individual asset price (or efficiency)
profile to give the price (or efficiency) profile of a cohort of assets.
Depending on the given combination method either the weighted average method
is used or the fixed profile method.}
\usage{
calcCohortProfile(survivalValues, config, profileConversionFunction = NULL,
  discountRate = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{survivalValues}{a vector of real numbers in the interval [0,1]
representing the survival function of a retirement distribution}

\item{config}{the configuration with the combination method, discount rate
inflation rate and any parameters for the profile function}

\item{profileConversionFunction}{one of (priceToEfficiencyProfile, efficiencyToPriceProfile)}
}
\value{
A vector of monotonically decreasing real numbers in the interval [0,1]
representing the price (or efficiency) profile of an asset vintage evaluated
at regular intervals of one period
}
\description{
Combines a given retirement distribution and individual asset price (or efficiency)
profile to give the price (or efficiency) profile of a cohort of assets.
Depending on the given combination method either the weighted average method
is used or the fixed profile method.
