#' Apply a split specification to data and apportion its values.
#'
#' Split a category (a Sector, Industry, or Asset) into smaller
#' sub-categories and divide its values between the sub-categories using the
#' provided proportions.
#'
#' @section Split Specification File:
#' The splits spec CSV file should have Sector, Industry, Asset, Split columns,
#' and additional columns for each Period containing the split proportions.
#' E.g. for a single sector split definition:
#'
#' \tabular{llllrrr}{
#' Sector \tab Industry \tab Asset \tab Split \tab Y1990Q1 \tab Y1990Q2 \tab ...\cr
#' S.1PT \tab ALL \tab ALL \tab S.11PR \tab 0.8 \tab 0.8 \tab ...\cr
#' S.1PT \tab ALL \tab ALL \tab S.14   \tab 0.1 \tab 0.1 \tab ...\cr
#' S.1PT \tab ALL \tab ALL \tab S.15   \tab 0.1 \tab 0.1 \tab ...
#' }
#'
#' A data.frame in the same format can be provided instead of a path to allow for
#' creation of split specifications on-the-fly.
#'
#' Split proportions should be in the range 0-1 and should sum to 1 when grouped
#' by Sector, Industry, and Asset. Any splits with proportions of zero are removed.
#'
#' The \emph{ALL} keyword can be used instead of specific Sectors, Industries, or
#' Assets in the specification file. Where \emph{ALL} occurs it will be expanded
#' to match the coverage in the \code{.data}.
#'
#' @section Split Matching:
#'
#' Splits are matched to the data by matching on all standard columns:
#' \code{Sector}, \code{Industry}, \code{Asset}, \code{Period}. Any data that
#' does not have a matching entry in the split specification is passed through
#' unchanged.
#'
#' Splits will first be matched to the coverage using the most detailed
#' specification, where all dimensions of joinKeys match, i.e. by
#' Sector, Industry, and Asset. Any remaining data will be matched more generally
#' by removing a joinKey, e.g. by matching on only Sector and Industry. Finally,
#' The splits will be matched by just Sector.
#'
#' The order of these iterations is controlled by the order of \code{joinKeys},
#' with each iteration removing the last element of \code{joinKeys} to make the
#' join more general.
#'
#' @param .data data.frame of GFCF data to be split.
#' @param spec String path to a CSV file containing split specification or a data.frame in the same format.
#' @param existingCategory String denoting the variable to split in .data. Common
#' to both \code{.data} and \code{splits}, e.g. "Sector".
#' @param newCategory String denoting the variable in the split specification containing the more detailed
#' level of \code{existingCategory}, e.g. "Split". Note, no spaces are allowed.
#' @param joinKeys character vector of dimensions defining matching priority, e.g. c("Asset", "Industry", "Sector").
#' See Split Matching for details.
#' @export
#' @return data.frame with matching rows split out as per the proportions.
